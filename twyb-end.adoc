After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing `CTRL+C`
in the command line session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal
from the `finish` directory in another shell session:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop
```
