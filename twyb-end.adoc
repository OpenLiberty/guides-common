After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing `CTRL+C`
in the command-line session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the `stop` goal
from the `finish` directory in another shell session:

[source, role="maven_section command"]
----
./mvnw liberty:stop
----

[source, role="gradle_section command"]
----
./gradlew libertyStop
----
