After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Liberty instance by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where you ran the instance. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal from the `finish` directory in another shell session:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop
```
