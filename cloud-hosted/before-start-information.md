# Instructions for this cloud-hosted guide

In this guide you will be using a pre-configured environment that runs in containers on the cloud.

On the left side you have the instructions. You can customise the instructions using the bar at the top. Move between steps using either the arrows or the buttons at the bottom. 

On the right side of the window you have the IDE. This is based of Visual Studio Code, it comes with pre installed tools and also has a built in terminal.
