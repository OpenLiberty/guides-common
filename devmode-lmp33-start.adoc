When you run Open Liberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and 
deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start Open Liberty in dev mode:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[source, role="maven_section command"]
----
mvnw liberty:dev
----
[source, role="gradle_section command"]
----
gradlew libertyDev
----
--
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[source, role="maven_section command"]
----
./mvnw liberty:dev
----
[source, role="gradle_section command"]
----
./gradlew libertyDev
----
--

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.
