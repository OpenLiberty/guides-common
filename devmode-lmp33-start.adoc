When you run Open Liberty in development mode, known as dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and 
deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start Open Liberty in dev mode:

[role=command]
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.
