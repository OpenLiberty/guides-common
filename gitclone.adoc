== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the projects that are provided inside:

[subs="attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-{projectid}.git
cd guide-{projectid}
----

The `start` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The `finish` directory contains the finished project, which is what you will build.
