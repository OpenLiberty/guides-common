= Title of guide, starting with a gerund (Creating, Administering, and so on)

// Start the introduction with "You'll explore how to..." or something similarly catchy:
Learn how to...
// Write no more than two sentences, or about fifty words with meaningful information on what the user can accomplish with this guide.
// Do not start the introduction with "This guide...".

// See the REST guide at as an exemplar guide.

// https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guide-rest-intro


== What you'll learn
// Write about what the user will learn in a meaningful intro paragraph.
// Follow the intro paragraph with more details of what the user will learn, but still keep it brief compared to the overall guide.

// You'll next add the various sections that are needed for a particular guide.


// Add this getting started section to your guide if it is applicable. Use the following include to pull in the git clone instructions from the guides-common repo.
== Getting started
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

// This is a subsection of the "Getting started" section above. It should briefly walk the user through
// how to setup everything in the "finish" directory and try out the finished version of what
// they will be building.
//=== Try what youâ€™ll build
include::{common-includes}/trywhatyoubuild-intro.adoc[]

// Describe what user expects to see after running the complete version of the application.

include::{common-includes}/trywhatyoubuild-end.adoc[]

//Write a sentence with the context like "Now, navigate to the `start` directory to begin." in the section where user starts working with the implementation.

// Add this section to your guide if it is applicable.
// Put this section in the appropriate order in your guide.
== Building and running the application

// Use the following include to pull in the Maven build instructions from the guides-common repo.
include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]

// In between here, you should state where you application can be found now that its running (ie. what urls)

// Use the following include to pull in the Liberty start/stop server instructions from the guides-common repo.
include::{common-includes}/mvncompile.adoc[]


== Section title for this section, starting with a gerund like Creating, Building, etc
// Read the wiki for the general rules of thumb to help you with formatting these next few sections:
// https://github.com/OpenLiberty/guides-common/wiki/Rules-of-thumb-for-formatting

// Start each additional section title with a meaningful gerund such as Creating, Building, Testing, Configuring, or Administering.
// Follow the gerund with a meaningful noun phrase. For example: Creating a JAX-RS application
// Have as many sections and section titles as needed.

// What to add for each section:
// We'll be writing these sections by following a flow similar to technical blog posts or college textbooks so that the user thinks about the content.
// Start each section with a meaningful description about what the user is doing in the section.
// Include code snippets.
// Avoid making all the documentation a series of steps and tasks, bullets, or numbered lists.
// Use tick marks around directories, files, values, class names, method names, and so on.
// Example: `this-is-a-file`, `this/is/a/path`, `thisIsAMethod`.


// Include this section if appropriate
== Running the tests

// Include this for info on how to run the tests
include::{common-includes}/mvnverify.adoc[]

// Including a listing block with test results here

// OPTIONAL: after listing the test results, mention a simple change a user can make/introduce that
// will cause the tests to fail. Be brief and don't give the users all of the instructions. At this
// point, they should be comfortable enough to figure it out on their own.


== Great work! You're done!

// Briefly summarize what the user achieved in this guide (1-2 sentences).

// OPTIONAL: briefly state what the user could do next now that they've learned the technologies in this guide.

// Include the below from the guides-common repo to tell users how they can contribute to the guide
include::{common-includes}/finish.adoc[]

// DO NO CREATE ANYMORE SECTIONS AT THIS POINT
// Related guides will be added in automatically here if you included them in ":page-related-guides"
