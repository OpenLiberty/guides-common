=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then run the following
goal to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[source, role="maven_section command"]

cd finish
mvnw install liberty:start
