== Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to have the following tools installed:

First, you will need a containerization software for building containers. {kube} supports a variety
of container types. You will use `Docker` in this guide. For installation instructions, see https://docs.docker.com/install/.

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

You will use the Docker Desktop, where a local {kube} environment is pre-installed and enabled. If you do not see the Kubernetes tab then you have an older version of Docker Desktop, upgrade to the latest version.

- Setup Docker for Windows as described at https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#kubernetes.
- Setup Docker for Mac as described at https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes.
- After following one of the sets of instructions, ensure that {kube} (not Swarm) is selected as the orchestrator.

[system]#*{linux}*#

You will use `Minikube` as a single-node {kube} cluster that runs locally in a virtual machine.
For Minikube installation instructions see https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube. Make sure to read the "Requirements" section as different operating systems require different prerequisites to get Minikube running.
