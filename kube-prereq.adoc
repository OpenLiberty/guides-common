Use Docker Desktop, where a local {kube} environment is pre-installed and enabled. If you do not see the _{kube}_ tab, then upgrade to the latest version of Docker Desktop.

Complete the setup for your operating system:

 - Set up  https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#kubernetes[Docker for Windows^]. 

After you complete the Docker setup instructions for your operating system, ensure that {kube} (not Swarm) is selected as the orchestrator in Docker Preferences.

You will use `Minikube` as a single-node {kube} cluster that runs locally in a virtual machine.
Make sure you have `kubectl` installed. If you need to install `kubectl`, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-linux[kubectl installation instructions^].
