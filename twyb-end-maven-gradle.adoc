After you are finished checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing `CTRL+C`
in the shell session where you ran the server. Alternatively, you can run the `liberty:stop` goal
from the `finish` directory in another shell session:

[.tab_link.maven_link]

[.tab_link.gradle_link]

[.tab_content]
[.maven_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:stop
```
--

[.tab_content]
[.gradle_section]
--
[role='command']
```
gradle libertyStop
```
--
