When you run Open Liberty in dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and 
deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start in dev mode:

[.tab_link.maven_link]
`   `
[.tab_link.gradle_link]
`    `

[.tab_content.maven_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:dev
```
--

[.tab_content.gradle_section]
--
[role='command']
```
gradle libertyDev
```
--

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
Press the Enter key to run tests on demand.
----

Dev mode holds your command line to listen for file changes. Open another command line to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.
