== Starting and preparing your cluster for deployment

Start up your {kube} cluster.

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

Start your Docker Desktop environment.

[system]#*{linux}*#

Run the following command from a command line:

```
minikube start
```

Later, when you no longer need your cluster, you can stop it with `minikube stop` and delete it completely
with `minikube delete`.
****

Next, validate that you have a healthy kubernetes environment by running the following command from the command line:
```
kubectl get nodes
```

This should return a `Ready` status for the master node.

****
[system]#*{win} | {mac}*#

You do not need to do any other step.

[system]#*{linux}*#

Run the following command to configure the Docker CLI to use Minikube's Docker daemon.
By running this command, you will be able to interact with Minikube's Docker daemon and build new
images directly to it from your host machine:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

When you no longer want to use Minikube's Docker daemon, run the following command to point back to your host:

```
eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
```
****
