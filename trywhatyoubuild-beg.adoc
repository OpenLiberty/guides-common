=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to build the application inside Open Liberty:
[role='command']
```
mvn install
```

Next, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal to start the application inside Open Liberty:
[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:start-server
```
