After making changes to the code, use the Maven `package` goal to rebuild the application and have the
running Open Liberty server pick up these changes automatically:

```
mvn package
```

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal from the command line:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```
