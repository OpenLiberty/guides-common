If you make changes to the code, use the Maven `compiule` goal to rebuild the application and have the
running Open Liberty server pick them up automatically. Make sure your application is using loose config 
for this to work:

```
mvn compile
```

To stop the Open Liberty server, run the Maven `liberty:stop-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```
