When you run Open Liberty in dev mode, the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and 
deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following goal to start in dev mode:

[role=command]
```
mvn liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application server in dev mode is ready:

[role="no_copy"]

Press the Enter key to run tests on demand.

Dev mode holds your command line to listen for file changes. Open another command line to continue, 
or open the project in your editor.
