== Building and running the application

To build the application, run the `install` Maven goal from the command line:

```
mvn install
```

This goal builds the application and creates a `.war` file in the target directory. The goal also
configures and installs Open Liberty into the `target/liberty/wlp` directory.

Next, run the `liberty:start-server` Maven goal:

```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven `pom.xml` is already configured to start
the application in this server instance.
