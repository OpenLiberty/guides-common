== Building and running the application

To build the application, run the Maven `install` phase from the active command-line session in the `start` directory:

```
mvn install
```

This command builds the application and creates a `.war` file in the target directory. It also
configures and installs Open Liberty into the `target/liberty/wlp` directory.

Next, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` goal:

```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

This goal starts an Open Liberty server instance. Your Maven `pom.xml` is already configured to start
the application in this server instance.
